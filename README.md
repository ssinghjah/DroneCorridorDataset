# DroneCorridorDataset
Drone corridors can be imagined as three dimensional highways in the sky, and are designed to support UAV operations. This dataset contains channel matrices and signal strength distribution in such a drone corridor located in the dense urban region of Manhattan, when using ground BSs equipped with three antenna arrays, to provide 360 degree horizontal coverage. The ground BSs operate at mmWave frequencies. This dataset can be serve as the wireless channel model for higher level applications and optimizations, such as UAV trajectory design in drone corridors, to meet communication constraints.
